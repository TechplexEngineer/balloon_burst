HAB Balloon Burst Calculator
========

Based on work from [CUSF](http://www.cusf.co.uk/)

This version allows for the generation of a table of values for variosu requested ascent rates.
Also new is the offset field. We [UMHAB](http://umhab.org) use a laundry detergent jug filled with water as a counter weight when filling the balloon. When we calculate the weight needed or the jug, we have to subtract the weight of the nozzle used to fill the balloon. Thats why the nozzle mass field comes from. So offset = neck lift - nozzle mass
